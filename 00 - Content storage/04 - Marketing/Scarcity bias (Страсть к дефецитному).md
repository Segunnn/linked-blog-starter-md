The [scarcity bias](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/full-frontal-psychology/spinning-class-the-scarcity-heuristic-and-me.html) states that the more difficult it is to acquire an item the more we value it. In other words, if we think something is scarce, we want it more. The recent run on toilet paper is just one recent example. But the Scarcity Bias is much more common than you may think. Whether it’s concert tickets for your favourite band, a popular brand of running shoe or a limited-edition collectible – if you think something is scarce, you tend to see it as more valuable.

The key word here is _think._ Something doesn’t have to _be_ scarce to make us want it more. We only have to _think_ it’s scarce. And marketers know this.
